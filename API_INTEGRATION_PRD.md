# Real-Time Seat Booking API Integration - PRD & Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development of a comprehensive API system that enables external booking platforms to integrate with our venue seat management system in real-time. The API will provide seat map data, real-time availability updates, and booking capabilities while maintaining data consistency across multiple booking channels.

## Problem Statement

Currently, our seat booking system operates in isolation. To maximize venue utilization and provide multiple booking channels, we need to:
- Allow external booking systems to access real-time seat availability
- Enable third-party platforms to reserve and book seats
- Maintain data consistency across all booking channels
- Provide real-time updates to all connected systems

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Real-time Integration**: Enable external systems to interact with our seat map in real-time
2. **Multi-channel Booking**: Support multiple booking platforms simultaneously
3. **Data Consistency**: Ensure seat availability is accurate across all channels
4. **Scalability**: Handle multiple concurrent booking requests efficiently

### Success Metrics
- API response time < 200ms for seat queries
- 99.9% uptime for real-time updates
- Zero double-booking incidents
- Support for 10+ concurrent external integrations

## User Stories

### External Booking System (API Consumer)
- As an external booking platform, I want to fetch the current seat map layout so I can display it to my users
- As an external system, I want to get real-time seat availability so my users see accurate information
- As a booking platform, I want to reserve seats temporarily so users can complete their purchase
- As an external system, I want to confirm bookings so seats are marked as sold
- As a booking platform, I want to receive real-time updates when seats are booked by other systems

### Venue Administrator
- As a venue admin, I want to see all bookings from all channels in one unified view
- As an admin, I want to configure which external systems can access our API
- As an admin, I want to monitor API usage and performance

}

Response:
{
  "token": "jwt-token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "permissions": ["read", "book"]
}
```

### Seat Map
```http
GET /api/venues/1/seat-map
Authorization: Bearer jwt-token

Response:
{
  "venue_id": 1,
  "name": "Main Theater",
  "layout": {
    "rows": 10,
    "seats_per_row": 10,
    "categories": [
      {
        "name": "Premium",
        "rows": [1, 2, 3],

        "color": "#8B5CF6"
      }
    ]
  },
  "seats": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "row": 1,
      "number": 1,
      "category": "Premium",
      "status": "available"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Real-time Updates
```javascript
// WebSocket connection
const socket = io('ws://localhost:3004/venues/1/shows/1');

socket.on('seat_status_changed', (data) => {
  console.log('Seat status update:', data);
  // { seat_id: 1, status: 'reserved', reserved_until: '2024-01-01T12:00:00Z' }
});

socket.on('booking_confirmed', (data) => {
  console.log('New booking:', data);
  // { booking_id: 'uuid', seat_ids: [1, 2], total_price: 300 }
});
```

### Reservation
```http
POST /api/reservations
Authorization: Bearer jwt-token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "show_id": 1,
  "seat_ids": [1, 2],
  "external_booking_id": "ext-booking-123",
  "hold_duration_minutes": 10
}

Response:
{
  "reservation_id": "uuid",
  "seat_ids": [1, 2],
  "expires_at": "2024-01-01T12:10:00Z",

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple systems booking same seats simultaneously
   - **Mitigation**: Optimistic locking, database constraints, reservation system

2. **System Overload**: High concurrent load causing performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, caching, load testing, horizontal scaling

3. **Data Inconsistency**: Seat status out of sync across systems
   - **Mitigation**: Single source of truth, real-time updates, transaction management

### Medium Risk
1. **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Clients losing real-time updates
   - **Mitigation**: Connection retry logic, heartbeat monitoring, fallback polling

2. **API Abuse**: Malicious or excessive API usage
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, API key management, monitoring

### Low Risk
1. **Documentation Gaps**: Integration difficulties for external developers
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation, example code, SDK development

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Review**: Get approval for scope and timeline
2. **Team Assignment**: Assign developers to each phase
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development and staging environments
4. **Phase 1 Kickoff**: Begin with database schema and authentication
5. **Weekly Reviews**: Track progress and adjust timeline as needed
