# Interactive Seat Map Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Structure and Layout
1. Create a new page component at `src/app/seat-map/page.tsx`
2. Implement a basic canvas-based layout using SVG
3. Add zoom and pan controls
4. Set up basic seat rendering

## Phase 2: Interactive Features
1. Seat Selection
   - Click to select/deselect seats
   - Visual feedback for selected seats
   - Seat status indicators (available, booked, reserved)
   - Hover effects with seat information

2. Navigation Controls
   - Zoom in/out buttons
   - Pan controls
   - Reset view button
   - Mini-map for navigation

3. Real-time Updates
   - WebSocket integration for live seat status
   - Optimistic updates for seat selection
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent bookings

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Seat Grouping
   - Group seats by section
   - Bulk selection of seats
   - Price zones
   - Accessibility seating

2. Search and Filter
   - Search by seat number
   - Filter by section
   - Filter by price
   - Filter by availability

3. Booking Flow
   - Add to cart functionality
   - Booking timer
   - Seat hold mechanism
   - Booking confirmation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Components Structure
```
src/
  components/
    seat-map/
      SeatMap.tsx           # Main component
      Seat.tsx             # Individual seat component
      Controls.tsx         # Navigation controls
      Legend.tsx           # Seat status legend
      MiniMap.tsx          # Navigation mini-map
      SearchBar.tsx        # Search and filter
      BookingPanel.tsx     # Booking information
```

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Track selected seats
- Manage zoom level and pan position
- Handle booking status

### Data Flow
1. Load initial seat data from Prisma
2. Subscribe to WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Update local state for user interactions
4. Sync with server for persistent changes

### Performance Considerations
1. Implement virtual rendering for large venues
2. Use React.memo for seat components
3. Optimize SVG rendering
4. Implement debouncing for frequent updates

### Accessibility Features
1. Keyboard navigation
2. Screen reader support
3. High contrast mode
4. ARIA labels and roles

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Basic Setup
1. Create necessary components
2. Set up basic SVG canvas
3. Implement zoom/pan functionality
4. Add basic seat rendering

### Step 2: Core Features
1. Implement seat selection
2. Add real-time updates
3. Create booking flow
4. Add search and filter

### Step 3: Polish
1. Add animations and transitions
2. Implement error handling
3. Add loading states
4. Optimize performance

### Step 4: Testing
1. Unit tests for components
2. Integration tests for booking flow
3. Performance testing
4. Accessibility testing

## Dependencies
- `react-spring` for animations
- `socket.io-client` for real-time updates
- `zustand` for state management
- `@radix-ui/react-*` for UI components
- `framer-motion` for advanced animations

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 4-5 days
- Testing and Polish: 2-3 days

Total: 11-15 days for complete implementation
